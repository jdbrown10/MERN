//JS DOES SO MANY THINGS

//mongo -> we'll come back to this
//express -> node backend (basically like a flask server)
//react -> it's basically node but it displays in your browser
//node -> js used outside of the browser. it's still js, browser-specific things just don't work in node (like alert, etc)

//electron -> a way where you can make react applications but it works outside of the browser (like a desktop app)
//react native -> react as a phone app
//mongoDB -> js as a database

//js is an interpreted language (like python) (as opposed to compiling language like c#, java, c++, etc)
//in a compiled language, the entire program gets put together from front to back before it runs, and if there's an error, it will not compile
//in an interpreted language, it runs without checking for errors first, and then errors will just mess stuff up if they exist
