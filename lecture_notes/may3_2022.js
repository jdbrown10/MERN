//four pillars of OOP

//encapsulation
//abstraction

//inheritance
//polymorphism

//Inheritance
//there are general ideas of what a robot is: all robots have a battery, made of metal, an antenna, and can move. subcategories (children) of robots will all inherit these traits.

//Polymorphism
//there can be many different types of robots -> there can be a dog robot, a human robot, a cleaning robot. They all inherit the same general robot traits, but they also have traits that make them unique.

//Abstraction
//the processes that a robot completes might be VERY complicated under the hood, but we can just say it can Move and we know what that means (instead of showing the inner workings)
//move (10)
//recharge (1000)

//Encapsulation
//a complex process that has numerous steps can be condensed into a single term -- instead of saying "pick up foot, move it forward, put it back down, etc etc" we can just say "Walk", which is one work that captures the whole process
//move (paramater)
////do x
////do y
////do z
